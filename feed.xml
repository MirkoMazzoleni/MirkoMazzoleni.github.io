The aim of this work is to familiarize with the data for subsequent analysis, and using the Tufte design rules to represent the plots. During the process, personal domain knowledge (acquired from books and not the tv series) is used to motivate hypothesis and decisions. Since there aren’t motivations or questions that brought me to collect data, in order to answer to them, we let the Exploratory Data Analysis phase to generate questions for us. A sound answer to those questions would require at least another dataset, so we let to fix in mind the fact that we are simply describing the dataset at hand, without the temptation to make inferences or other types of final statements.</p> <p>The entire code for this post can be found <a href="https://github.com/MirkoMazzoleni/MirkoMazzoleni.github.io/blob/master/assets/code/2016-08-05-game_of_tutfe.Rmd">here</a>.</p> <h2 id="data-cleaning-and-questions-generation">Data cleaning and questions generation</h2> <p>After having load the required libraries and the dataset, which contains information about the main battles in the reign of Westeros during the <a href="ttp://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/War_of_the_Five_Kings">War of the Five Kings</a>, let’s first take an overview of the dataset at hand by checking the variables at our disposal. We can see \(38\) observations for each of the \(25\) variables.

We can see that there is an error in the data, because we know that Stannis Baratheon was on the Night’s side, defending the Nigth’s Watch and seizing Mance Rayder. Furthermore, Stannis won the battle and Mance Rayder lost it, thus the <em>attacker_king</em> and <em>defender_king</em> variables should be swapped. The number of \(100000\) is more meaningful now if we think of it as the army of all the freefolks, as it is also reported <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_Castle_Black">here</a>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>           name               attacker_king     defender_king   attacker_1    defender_1    attacker_outcome

</code></pre></div></div> <p><strong>Question Q15</strong>: When attacking, which battle type required more men? <strong>Expectation E15</strong>: Probably the <em>pitched battle</em> type, since it requires more men than ambush or a siege, which require more discretion and tools (trebuchets, rams) capability respectively. <strong>Answer 15</strong>: The <em>pitched battle</em> has the higher median (about \(10000\) troops) and it is very skewed around this value, and only \(25%\) of values are lower than \(3000\) troops. Perhaps surprising, the median of the <em>ambush</em> distribution is similar to that of <em>siege</em>, being the latter more concentrated, indicating that there some standard number of troops to do a siege. Here we have isolated cases of ambushes with less than \(30\) men, and a siege with \(100000\) men (the Mance Rayder attack to Castle Black). We Do not consider “unknown” o “razing” battles since they have few or none observations. <img src="/images/2016-08-06-games_of_tufte/unnamed-chunk-35-1.svg" alt=""/></p> <p><strong>Question Q16</strong>: When attacking, which king had the most numerous army? <strong>Expectation E16</strong>: We already know that Mance Rayder commanded \(100000\) men. <strong>Answer 16</strong>: Mance had the most numerous attacking army, but he attacked only one time, so it is more interesting to considered the other kings. I made the choice to exclude from the comparison also the “NoKing” category, since it has few observations. We can see from the plot that the Greyjoy’s had the smallest army, ranging from \(10\) to \(1000\) men. The Lannister’s and the Stark’s show a high median value army, but that also had great variation in its forces, mainly for Robb Stark. This can be probably due to his attitude to perform ambush attacks with few men. Stannis Baratheon forces undergo few losses, having a quite concentrated distribution. <img src="/images/2016-08-06-games_of_tufte/unnamed-chunk-36-1.svg" alt=""/></p> <h4 id="defender-size">Defender size</h4> <p>The size of the defender’s force.
