I am an assistant professor at Department of Management, Information and Production Engineering, University of Bergamo, Italy. 

My research interests concern the development of theory and practice of *system identification* and *supervision* algorithms for dynamical systems. I also work on the intersection of data science, signal processing and machine learning. Currently, I am interested in these specific topics:
- kernel methods for system identification
- signal processing on graphs
- analysis of vibration signals
- robust and data-driven fault detection
- processes for the development of supervision solutions
- prognostics with scenario-based optimization approaches

I am co-founder of <a href='https://aisent.io/en/'>AISent srl</a> whose mission is to create impactful solutions for the industry through technology.
