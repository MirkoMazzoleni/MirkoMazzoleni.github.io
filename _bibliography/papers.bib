  abstract = {In this paper, the use of the Principal Direction Divisive Partitioning (PDDP) method for unsupervised learning is discussed and analyzed with a focus on fault detection applications. Specifically, a geometric limit of the standard algorithm is highlighted by means of a simulation example and a modified version of PDDP is introduced. Such a method is shown to correctly perform data clustering also when the standard algorithm fails. The modified strategy is based on the use of a Chi-squared statistical test and offers more guarantees in terms of detection of a wrong functioning of the system. The proposed algorithm is finally experimentally tested on a fault detection application for aerospace electro-mechanical actuators, for which a comparison with k-means and fuzzy k-means approaches is also provided.},

The injected mechanical defects consisted in damages undergone by steel spheres, inside a ballscrew transmission system.

This technique permits to represent a single word through a vector, giving a methematical representation of the word's semantic. The focus of the work is to assign the percentage of the aforementioned emotions to short sentences. The method has been tested on a collection of Twitter messages and on the SemEval 2007 news headlines dataset.

An important element of the actuator control system is a Health Monitoring (HM) module. This component is an algorithm able to detect anomalies in the device even if there is no evident loss of ability in pursuing its main function (position tracking). In particular, the project aim is to identify any degradation in the mechanical transmission elements, the ballscrew and other components such as bearings. Moreover, it is strongly advisable that the HM algorithm is based on a feature whose value can be easily computed and monitored during the actuator life. In this work, a large experimental activity has been carried out with the purpose of bringing the actuator close to failure, by progressive fault injection in overload operating conditions. A feature named Σ, that is, the mean of the RMS of the three phase currents (the input to the electric motor), is proposed as a parameter for HM. The effectiveness of this parameter in detecting the mechanical transmission degradation is experimentally tested. The degradation has been confirmed by visual inspection and screw thread profile measurements. In spite of this, the actuator is still able to perform position tracking in an effective way.},

The proposed methodology exploits the potential of manifold learning on an artificially augmented dataset, obtained without running new experiments on the plant. The additional data are employed for approximating the manifold where input regressors lie. The knowledge of the manifold acts as a prior information on the system, that induces a proper regularization term on the identification cost. The new regularization term, as opposite to the standard Tikhonov one, enforces local smoothness of the function along the manifold. A graph-based algorithm tailored to dynamical systems is proposed to generate the augmented dataset. The hyperparameters of the method, along with the order of the system, are estimated from the available data.

The clinical protocol consists of trying to mentally repel drug-related images, and a Stroop test is used to evaluate the blue therapy effect. The method requires a BCI hardware package and a software program which communicates with the device. In order to improve the BCI detection rates, data were collected from five different healthy subjects during the training. These measurements are then used to design a better classification algorithm with respect to the default BCI classifier. The investigated algorithms are logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors and Naive Bayes. Although the low number of participants is not enough to guarantee statistically significant results, the designed algorithms perform better than the default one, in terms of accuracy, F1-score and area under the curve (AUC). The Naive Bayes method has been chosen as the best classifier between the tested ones, giving a +12.21% performance boost as concerns the F1-score metric. The presented methodology can be extended to other types of craving problems, such as food, pornography and alcohol. Results relative to the effectiveness of the proposed approach are reported on a set of patients with drug craving problems.},

The four indicators are computed by leveraging the output from a Statistical Process Monitoring (SPM) method based on multivariate statistics, such as the Hotelling's T 2 statistic and the Q statistic. SPM approaches give a dichotomous answer, i.e. the presence/absence of a fault. In this work, we propose four ways to compute a continuous indicator starting from the discrete SPM output, that is better suited for health monitoring. We test the approach using a dataset collected from a large experimental campaign on a 1:1 scale EMA for primary flight controls of small aircrafts, that led to EMA failure. Results show the effectiveness of the method.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a simulation study to investigate the role of manifold regularization in kernel-based approaches for nonparametric nonlinear SISO (Single-Input Single-Output) system identification. This problem is tackled as the estimation of a static nonlinear function that maps regressors (that contain past values of both input and output of the dynamic system) to the system outputs. Manifold regularization, as opposite to the Tikhonov one, enforces a local smoothing constraint on the estimated function. It is based on the assumption that the regressors lie on a manifold in the regressors space. This manifold is usually approximated with a weighted graph that connects the regressors. The present work analyzes the performance of kernel-based methods estimates when different choices are made for the graph connections and their respective weights. The approach is tested on benchmark nonlinear systems models, for different connections and weights strategies. Results give an intuition about the most promising choices in order to adopt manifold regularization for system identification.},

The typical way to compute the solution of this learning problem subsumes the inversion of the kernel matrix. However, due to limited machine precision, this might not be possible in many practical applications. In this article, we analyze the aforementioned problem and show that the typical estimate is just one of the possible infinite solutions that can be leveraged, considering both the supervised and the semisupervised settings. We show under which conditions the infinite solutions are equivalent, and if it is not the case, we provide a bound on the mismatch between two generic solutions.

However, for such models, model selection is a hard task if no prior physical knowledge is given. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric approach to infer a continuous-time linear model from data, by automatically selecting a proper structure of the transfer function and guaranteeing to preserve the system stability properties. By means of benchmark simulation examples, the proposed approach is shown to outperform state-of-the-art continuous-time methods, also in the critical case when short sequences of canonical input signals, like impulses or steps, are used for model learning. },

Thus, a learning model trained on data from a set of items can perform poorly when applied to other ones. The proposed solution comprises tailored normalization and cross validation procedures for training the classifier, along with suitable End Of Line (EOL) experiments for the characterization of a new produced EMA item.

Undoubtedly, they would extremely benefit from Industry 4.0 advancements in predicting anomalies and breakdowns. However, in these industries, the adoption of predictive maintenance methodologies based on the analysis of historical data is a challenging task. Indeed, to avoid costly and dangerous breakdowns, plant managers prefer to apply an early substitution of machine components long before the end of their useful life, making data on fault events, as well as trends on parts degradation, rarely available. This paper reports the outcome of an industrial research project on data-driven fault diagnosis in a steel making production process. The study aims to identify early stage degradations in rotating machines components in hot rolling mill lines. We compare two methodologies: a well-known frequency-domain analysis of vibrations data is correlated with an ad-hoc designed statistical analysis. The comparison has been conducted on experimental data collected in a steel making plant placed in the South of Italy.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in machine learning applications are deeply concerned with the poor interpretability of most of these techniques. To gain some insights in the process of designing data-based models it is common to graphically represent the algorithm’s results, either in their final or intermediate stage. Specially challenging is the task of plotting multiclass classification results as they involve categorical variables (classes) rather than numeric results. Using the well-known MNIST dataset and a simple neural network as an example, this paper reviews the existing techniques to visualize classification results, from those centered on a particular instance or set of instances, to those representing an overall performance metric. As classification results are commonly summarized in the form of a confusion matrix, special attention is paid to its graphical representation. From this analysis, a new visualization tool is derived, which is presented in two forms: confusion star and confusion gear. The confusion star is centered on the classification errors, while the confusion gear focuses on the classification hits. The proposed visualization tools are also evaluated when facing: (i) balanced and imbalanced classifiers issues; (ii) the problem of representing errors with different orders of magnitude. By using shapes instead of colors to represent the value of each matrix cell, the new tools significantly improve the readability of the confusion matrices. Furthermore, we show how the area enclosed by the confusion stars and gears are directly related to standard classification metrics. The new graphic tools can be also usefully employed to visualize the performances of a sequence of classifiers.},

  abstract = {In quantitative finance, multi-period portfolio optimization can be reformulated as a stochastic optimal control problem, and standard feedback tools can be employed for its analysis. The performance of the trading solutions strongly depend on the quality of the model of the returns. Therefore, data-driven solutions have been recently proposed to optimize simple-linear allocation policies, based only on a set of possible market scenarios. In this work, kernel-based methods are proposed to design more complex and effective control actions, providing better trade-offs in terms of risk and investment performance with respect to linear ones, by preserving convexity. The proposed approach relies on the minimization of the Lower Partial Moments (LPM) risk measure. The effectiveness of the method is shown on a set of real historical financial data.},

  abstract = {Preference-based optimization algorithms are iterative procedures that seek the optimal calibration of a decision vector based only on comparisons between couples of different tunings. At each iteration, a human decision-maker expresses a preference between two calibrations (samples), highlighting which one, if any, is better than the other. The optimization procedure must use the observed preferences to find the tuning of the decision vector that is most preferred by the decision-maker, while also minimizing the number of comparisons. In this work, we formulate the preference-based optimization problem from a utility theory perspective. Then, we propose GLISp-r, an extension of a recent preference-based optimization procedure called GLISp. The latter uses a Radial Basis Function surrogate to describe the tastes of the decision-maker. Iteratively, GLISp proposes new samples to compare with the best calibration available by trading off exploitation of the surrogate model and exploration of the decision space. In GLISp-r, we propose a different criterion to use when looking for new candidate samples that is inspired by MSRS, a popular procedure in the black-box optimization framework. Compared to GLISp, GLISp-r is less likely to get stuck on local optima of the preference-based optimization problem. We motivate this claim theoretically, with a proof of global convergence, and empirically, by comparing the performances of GLISp and GLISp-r on several benchmark optimization problems.},

  abstract = {Black-box and preference-based optimization algorithms are global optimization procedures that aim to find the global solutions of an optimization problem using, respectively, the least amount of function evaluations or sample comparisons as possible. In the black-box case, the analytical expression of the objective function is unknown and it can only be evaluated through a (costly) computer simulation or an experiment. In the preference-based case, the objective function is still unknown but it corresponds to the subjective criterion of an individual. So, it is not possible to quantify such criterion in a reliable and consistent way. Therefore, preference-based optimization algorithms seek global solutions using only comparisons between couples of different samples, for which a human decision-maker indicates which of the two is preferred. Quite often, the black-box and preference-based frameworks are covered separately and are handled using different techniques. In this paper, we show that black-box and preference-based optimization problems are closely related and can be solved using the same family of approaches, namely surrogate-based methods. Moreover, we propose the generalized Metric Response Surface (gMRS) algorithm, an optimization scheme that is a generalization of the popular MSRS framework. Finally, we provide a convergence proof for the proposed optimization method.},

  abstract = {
  In Italy, the administration of COVID-19 vaccines began in late 2020. In the early stages, the number of available doses was limited. To maximize the effectiveness of the vaccine campaign, the national health agency assigned priority access to at-risk individuals, such as health care workers and the elderly. Current vaccination campaign strategies do not take full advantage of the latest mathematical models, which capture many subtle nuances, allowing different territorial situations to be analyzed aiming to make context-specific decisions.
  The main objective is the definition of an agent-based model using open data and scientific literature to assess and optimize the impact of vaccine campaigns for an Italian region. Specifically, the aim is twofold: (i) estimate the reduction in the number of infections and deaths attributable to vaccines, and (ii) assess the performances of alternative vaccine allocation strategies.
  The COVID-19 Agent-based simulator Covasim has been employed to build an agent-based model by considering the Lombardy region as case study. The model has been tailored by leveraging open data and knowledge from the scientific literature. Dynamic mobility restrictions and the presence of Variant of Concern have been explicitly represented. Free parameters have been calibrated using the grid search methodology.
  The model mimics the COVID-19 wave that hit Lombardy from September 2020 to April 2021. It suggests that 168,492 cumulative infections 2,990 cumulative deaths have been avoided due to the vaccination campaign in Lombardy from January 1 to April 30, 2021. Without vaccines, the number of deaths would have been 66% greater in the 80–89 age group and 114% greater for those over 90. The best vaccine allocation strategy depends on the goal. To minimize infections, the best policy is related to dose availability. If at least 1/3 of the population can be covered in 4 months, targeting at-risk individuals and the elderly first is recommended; otherwise, the youngest people should be vaccinated first. To minimize overall deaths, priority is best given to at-risk groups and the elderly in all scenarios.
  This work proposes a methodological approach that leverages open data and scientific literature to build a model of COVID-19 capable of assessing and optimizing the impact of vaccine campaigns. This methodology can help national institutions to design regional mathematical models that can support pandemic-related decision-making processes.},

However, process and fault models are not usually available for complex productions plants and production data are usually unlabeled. Thus, to classify machine status, unsupervised approaches such as anomaly detection and signal processing strategies have to be employed. Due to the unsupervised nature of the problem, it is meaningful to apply several diagnostic algorithms to cover most of the process anomalous behaviors. Additionally, in some contexts, the experience of process operators in grasping the correct functioning of machines as well as their ability in understanding early signs of deterioration is relevant for the diagnosis of incoming failures. However, seldom these information can be included in failure diagnosis algorithms. In this paper, we propose a diagnostic scheme for condition monitoring of mechanical components. The proposed scheme combines anomaly detection algorithms, envelope analysis of vibration data, and eventually additional qualitative information on machine functioning. The combination of all the fault indicators is obtained leveraging on a fuzzy inference system. The proposed scheme is experimentally validated on a steel making plant with real process data, making use of heuristic information such monitoring reports of machine health status.},

We finally compare our approach with a benchmark prediction-error method on a numerical case study. Simulation results illustrate that kernel-based identification might be more suited for robust control, due to its low-bias modeling capability.},

  abstract ={Wine is a relevant part of the diet in many countries, showing significant nutritional properties, providing health benefits to consumers, and having a significant weight in economy. Also, wine plays an important role in many cultures as a part of their social relationships, feasts, or religion where some of them may become a sign of luxury and distinction. For those reasons, objective and subjective quality of wines is an important issue in their production and marketing. To improve wine excellence, some production methods try to relate its physicochemical properties to the quality as it is perceived by humans. Then, modern data prescriptive analysis can be applied to measure the importance (the influence) of each wine attribute. This paper examines and compare several metrics of the attribute importance and its application to the quality-aware design and production of wines. Moreover, for the cases where the perceived quality is characterized using a discrete value, a novel importance metric, based on the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) is introduced and compared to the existing ones. The results show that JSD clearly overperforms other metrics previously proposed in the literature. Also, it can be asserted that JSD properly reflects the importance of discrete multivalued functions. The results, using this metric in an importance performance analysis of a public wine dataset, show that the main physicochemical attributes of a red wine are citric acidity, alcohol, sulphates and fixed acidity. As for the white wine case, the main attributes are alcohol, free sulfure dioxide and pH.},

  abstract = {Predictive maintenance (PdM) is a set of actions and techniques to early detect failures and defects on machines before they occur, and the usage of machine learning and deep learning techniques in predictive maintenance has increased during the last years. Even with this increase of the literature, there is still a gap concerning the application of such techniques for PdM in the industry, as there are no clear guidelines about which information to use for a PdM system, how to process the information, and what machine learning techniques should be used in order to obtain acceptable results. This scoping review is performed in order to observe the current status on the use of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in predictive maintenance in academia and provide answer to the questions related to these guidelines. For this purpose, a literature review of the last five years is carried out, using those articles that cover information about sources of information used for PdM, the treatment given to such data and the machine learning (ML) methods or techniques used. The Web of Science: Core Collection database is used as a source of information, specifically the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE). The review shows that there are different information sources used for machine learning and deep learning in PdM, depending on the origin of the data and the availability of it, and as well whether the data sets are private or public. Also, we can observe that data used for both training and making predictions does not only use traditional pre-processing techniques, but that about one fifth of the articles even propose new techniques in this field. Additionally, we compare a wide range of techniques and algorithms which are used in Deep Learning - being ANN the most used- and in Machine Learning, being SVM the most used algorithm, closely followed by Random Forest. Based on the results, we provide indications about how to apply ML for PdM in industry.},

In this work, we introduce several improvements to the Feature Representation and Alignment Network (FRAN) architecture described in (Chen et al., 2020) devised with the diagnostic transfer learning purpose. Our approach, named FRAN-X, presents improved transfer and diagnostics performance between identical machines in different operating conditions, and it is computationally lighter than its original counterpart.

  ABSTRACT = {Barotrauma occurs in a significant number of patients with COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia undergoing mechanical ventilation. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether the Brixia score (BS) calculated on chest-X-rays acquired at the Emergency Room was associated with barotrauma. We retrospectively evaluated 117 SARS-CoV-2 patients presented to the Emergency Department (ED) and then admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation between February and April 2020. Subjects were divided into two groups according to the occurrence of barotrauma during their hospitalization. CXRs performed at ED admittance were assessed using the Brixia score. Distribution of barotrauma (pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema) was identified in chest CT scans. Thirty-eight subjects (32.5%) developed barotrauma (25 pneumomediastinum, 24 pneumothorax, 24 subcutaneous emphysema). In the barotrauma group we observed higher Brixia score values compared to the non-barotrauma group (mean value 12.18 vs. 9.28), and logistic regression analysis confirmed that Brixia score is associated with the risk of barotrauma. In this work, we also evaluated the relationship between barotrauma and clinical and ventilatory parameters: SOFA score calculated at ICU admittance and number of days of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) prior to intubation emerged as other potential predictors of barotrauma.},

  abstract = {Robustness of residual signals to model uncertain-ties and noise in the measurements is of paramount importance in model-based fault diagnosis. Model uncertainty has been mainly represented in a structured way by considering known bounds on the model parameters, thus relying on prior knowledge about the plant structure and values of its physical parameters. When the plant is completely unknown, system identification techniques must be used for model-based diagnosis. In this work, we present a data-driven approach to represent the uncertainty in the identified model. This uncertainty is described in the frequency domain using kernel-based identification and robust control tools. The estimated model uncertainty region overlaps with the true uncertainty region with a probability specified by the user. The user choices are thus reduced to the selection of only some interpretable hyperparameters. Then, a residual generator robust to the es-timated model uncertainty and measurements noise is designed by a standard H∞ approach. Simulation results on SISO LTI systems show the effectiveness of the approach in producing a residual signal viable for the detection of additive faults.},

  abstract = {Although the suppression of mechanical resonances for drive and positioning systems is a well-understood problem in the literature, its importance is still actual as technological developments push towards an increase in performance requirements. In this paper, the design of a notch filter is investigated with the aim of suppressing a single resonant frequency in SISO LTI two-mass drive systems. In the cases where the notch filter is located inside an existing control loop, as assumed in this work, it must not compromise the closed-loop stability of the system, while assuring desired control bandwidth and stability margins. Given a fixed known resonant frequency to suppress, an automatic algorithm is proposed to tune the notch filter parameters to guarantee specified control requirements and stability of the closed-loop system, so as to avoid, whenever possible, the reconfiguration of a preexisting controller.},

First, a literature review of the failure modes for SVs is reported. The failure regarding the impeded movement of the valve plunger is considered. The proposed CI for this failure mode is computed from only some significant points of the SVs excitation current and their time instants. The proposed CI is evaluated by a large endurance campaign on a set of SVs. Then, a Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation algorithm is proposed and evaluated on the experimental data. Experimental results show the goodness of the proposed CI for RUL estimation of cost-effective industrial DC SVs.},

  abstract = {Bottling machinery is an essential element in agri-food industries. The early detection of faulty conditions in this equipment can have a significant impact on its productivity and economic performance. Classifying vibration signals recorded in different health states enables an optimized maintenance procedure. These vibrations are usually characterized using the original signal samples or a very reduced set of features specifically designed for each application. In this paper, instead, it is proposed the use of a set of generic features obtained applying basic signal processing methods to the vibration signal. Artificial intelligence techniques have been used for an application in agri-food engineering, specifically for health monitoring of gripping pliers in bottling plants. As the purpose of this research is to compare different ways of describing vibrations, a particular classifier has been used, the random forest classifier. The results obtained show that the proposed method clearly overperforms the other two alternatives in detecting and classifying faulty conditions while significantly reduce the required computational cost. Additionally, the proposed feature extraction method is more robust against randomly generated perturbations and requires a smaller number of instances to train the corresponding classifier.},

  abstract = {The advent of Industry 5.0 envisages production systems that are more resilient, embrace human–machine collaboration and promote sustainability driven by technological research. The development of supervision solutions for industrial equipment fills in this picture as a basis for more proactive Condition-Based Maintenance strategies. The goal of this paper is to provide a self-contained set of guidelines to design such supervision solutions. With respect to existing literature on the topic, we provide a design process with a strong focus on experimental data collection and failure reproduction activities. Moreover, the connections between the steps of the proposed process are clearly highlighted to guide the user. First, the paper provides a set of tools to select the critical items and the methodological approaches for supervision. Then, these tools are used and referenced in the proposed design process. Finally, the proposed process is exemplified on two industrial case studies to show its effectiveness. Considerations, hints, and a user guidelines are given at the end of most sections.},
